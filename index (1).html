<i><b><font size="6">Introduction</font></b></i>
<i><p><font="4">Indications of a growth in the volume of interest in Buddhism are noticeable in some sections 
of the Indian people. Along with it there is naturally a growing demand for a clear and consistent 
statement of the life and teachings of the Buddha.</p></i>

<i><p>Anyone who is not a Buddhist finds it extremely difficult to present the life and teachings of 
the Buddha in a manner which would make it a consistent whole. Depending on the Nikayas, not 
only the presentation of a consistent story of the life of the Buddha becomes a difficult thing and 
the presentation of some parts of his teachings becomes much more so. Indeed it would not be 
an exaggeration to say that of all the founders of religions in the world, the presentation of the 
life and teachings of the founder of Buddhism presents a problem which is quite puzzling if not 
baffling. Is it not necessary that these problems should be solved, and the path for the 
understanding of Buddhism be made clear? Is it not time that those who are Buddhists should 
take up these problems, at least for general discussion, and throw what light they can on these 
problems?</p></i>

<i><p>With a view to raise a discussion on these problems, I propose to set them out here. The first 
problem relates to the main event in the life of the Buddha, namely, Parivraja. Why did the 
Buddha take Parivraja? The traditional answer is that he took Parivraja because he saw a dead 
person, a sick person and an old person. This answer is absurd on the face of it. The Buddha 
took Parivraja at the age of 29. If he took Parivraja as a result of these three sights, how is it he 
did not see these three sights earlier? These are common events occurring by hundreds, and the 
Buddha could not have failed to come across them earlier. It is impossible to accept the 
traditional explanation that this was the first time he saw them. The explanation is not plausible 
and does not appeal to reason. But if this is not the answer to the question, what is the real 
answer?</p></i>
 
<i><p>The second problem is created by the four Aryan Truths. Do they form part of the original 
teachings of the Buddha? This formula cuts at the root of Buddhism. If life is sorrow, death is 
sorrow, and rebirth is sorrow, then there is an end of everything. Neither religion nor philosophy 
can help a man to achieve happiness in the world. If there is no escape from sorrow, then what 
can religion do, what can Buddha do, to relieve man from such sorrow which is ever there in 
birth itself ? The four Aryan Truths are a great stumbling block in the way of non-Buddhists 
accepting the gospel of Buddhism. For the four Aryan Truths deny hope to man. The four Aryan 
Truths make the gospel of the Buddha a gospel of pessimism. Do they form part of the original 
gospel, or are they a later accretion by the monks?</p></i>

<i><p>The third problem relates to the doctrines of soul, of karma and rebirth. The Buddha denied 
the existence of the soul. But he is also said to have affirmed the doctrine of karma and rebirth. 
At once a question arises. If there is no soul, how can there be karma? If there is no soul, how 
can there be rebirth? These are baffling questions. In what sense did the Buddha use the words 
karma and rebirth? Did he use them in a different sense than the sense in which they were used 
by the Brahmins of his day? If so, in what sense? Did he use them in the same sense in which the 
Brahmins used them? If so, is there not a terrible contradiction between the denial of the soul 
and the affirmation of karma and rebirth? This contradiction needs to be resolved.</p></i>

<i><p>The fourth problem relates to the Bhikkhu. What was the object of the Buddha in creating 
the Bhikkhu? Was the object to create a perfect man? Or was his object to create a social servant 
devoting his life to service of the people and being their friend, guide and philosopher? This is a 
very real question. On it depends the future of Buddhism. If the Bhikkhu is only a perfect man 
he is of no use to the propagation of Buddhism, because though a perfect man he is a selfish 
man. If, on the other hand, he is a social servant, he may prove to be the hope of Buddhism. This 
question must be decided not so much in the interest of doctrinal consistency but in the interest 
of the future of Buddhism.</p></i>

<i><p>If I may say so, the pages of the journal of the Mahabodhi Society make, to me at any rate, 
dull reading. This is not because the material presented is not interesting and instructive. The 
dullness is due to the fact that it seems to fall upon a passive set of readers. After reading an 
article, one likes to know what the reader of the journal has to say about it. But the reader never 
gives out his reaction. This silence on the part of the reader is a great discouragement to the 
writer. I hope my questions will excite the readers to come and make their contribution to their 
solution</font></p><br>
<b><FONT SIZE="6">PROLOGUE</FONT></b><br>
<i><p><font size="4">"From time to time men find themselves forced to reconsider current and inherited beliefs 
and ideas, to gain some harmony between present and past experience, and to reach a position 
which shall satisfy the demands of feeling and reflexion and give confidence for facing the future. 
If, at the present day, religion, as a subject of critical or scientific inquiry, of both practical and 
theoretical significance has attracted increasing attention, this can be ascribed to (a) the rapid 
progress of scientific knowledge and thought; (b) the deeper intellectual interest in the subject; (c) 
the widespread tendencies in all parts of the world to reform or reconstruct religion, or even to 
replace it by some body of thought, more 'rational' and 'scientific' or less 'superstitious'; and (d) 
the effect of social, political, and international events of a sort which, in the past, have both 
influenced and been influenced by religion. Whenever the ethical or moral value of activities or 
conditions is questioned, the value of religion is involved; and all deep-stirring experiences 
invariably compel a reconsideration of the most fundamental ideas, whether they are explicitly 
religious or not. Ultimately there arise problems of justice, human destiny, God, and the universe; 
and these in turn involve problems of the relation between 'religious' and other ideas, the validity 
of ordinary knowledge, and practicable conceptions of 'experience' and 'reality'."

<i><p><font="3"><br><br>
1. Going back to the sixth century B.C., Northern India did not form a single Sovereign 
State.<br> 
    2. The country was divided into many States, some large, some small. Of these, some were 
monarchical and some non-monarchical. <br>
      3. The monarchical States were altogether sixteen in number. They were known by the 
name[s] of Anga, Magadha, Kasi, Kosala, Vriji, Malla, Chedi, Vatsa, Kuru, Panchala, Matsya, 
Saursena, Asmaka, Avanti, Gandhara, and Kambhoja.<br>
    4. The non-monarchical States were those of the Sakyas of Kapilvastu, the Mallas of Pava 
and Kushinara, the Lichhavis of Vaisali, the Videhas of Mithila, the Koliyas of Ramagam, the 
Bulis of Allakapa, the Kalingas of Resaputta, the Mauriyas of Pipphalvana, and the Bhaggas 
with their capital on Sumsumara Hill.<br> 
    5. The monarchical States were known as Janapada, and the non-monarchical as Sangh or 
Gana.<br> 
    6. Not much is known about the nature of the polity of the Sakyas of Kapilvatsu, whether 
it was republican or oligarchic.<br> 
      7. This much, however, is definitely known, that there were many ruling families in the 
Republic of the Sakyas, and that they ruled in turns. <br>
    8. The head of the ruling family was known as Raja.<br> 
    9. At the time of the birth of Siddharth Gautama, it was the turn of Suddhodana to be the 
Raja.<br> 
    10. The Sakya State was situated in the northeast corner of India. It was an independent 
State. But at a later stage the King of Kosala had succeeded in establishing his paramountcy over 
it.<br>	
      11. The result of this paramountcy was that the Sakya State could not exercise certain 
sovereign powers without the sanction of the King of Kosala. <br>
      12. Of the kingdoms then in existence, Kosala was a powerful kingdom. So was the 
kingdom of Magadha. Pasanedi, King of Kosala, and Bimbisara, King of Magadha, were the 
contemporaries of Siddharth Gautama.</i><font><br><br>
<b><i><font size="5">§ 2. His Ancestry</i></font><br><br></b>
<i><font size="4">
1. The capital of the Sakyas was the city called Kapilavatsu, perhaps after the name of the 
great Rationalist Kapila. <br>
      2. There lived in Kapilavastu a Sakya, by name Jaya Sena. Sinahu was his son. Sinahu was 
married to Kaccana. Sinahu had five sons, Suddhodana, Dhotodana, Sakkodana, Suklodana, 
and Amitodana. Besides five sons, Sinahu had two daughters, Amita and Pamita.<br> 
    3. The Gotra of the family was Aditya.<br> 
      4. Suddhodana was married to Mahamaya. Her father's name was Anjana, and mother's 
Sulakshana. Anjana was a Koliya, and was residing in the village called Devadaha.<br> 
      5. Suddhodana was a man of great military prowess. When Suddhodana had shown his 
martial powers, he was allowed to take a second wife, and he chose Mahaprajapati. She was the 
elder sister of Mahamaya.<br> 
    6. Suddhodana was a wealthy person. The lands he held were very extensive, and the retinue 
under him was very large. He employed, it is said, one thousand ploughs to till the land he 
owned.<br> 
    7. He lived quite a luxurious life and had many palaces.<br></font></i><br>
